## 🔍 Overview

This project lets users:
- ✏️ **Draw graphs** with nodes and edges visually using mouse clicks.
- 🧠 **Visualize algorithms** in action with clear step-by-step animations.
- 🔄 **Edit** the graph: move, delete, or reconnect nodes easily.
- 🌐 Run entirely in the browser — no backend required.

It's a powerful educational and demonstration tool for learning **graph theory** and **algorithm visualization**.
